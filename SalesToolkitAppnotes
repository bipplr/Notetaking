Quote search screen -> alternate row coloring by using 

With ( {records: Filter()}, ForAll(Sequence(CountRows(records)),Patch(Last(FirstN(records,Value)), {rowNumber: Value}))

Using the ForAll sequence inside PowerApps I'm patching the rownumber inside the records.


Big time saving hack -> using dataverse direct query to import the tables inside power bi and verify the field names
Even bigger time hack -> looking at the same data inside power query by filtering a quote number
Quesiton to Kev -> ASM name has changed for quote 1320460444
Dataverse connection name: orgee143f71.crm11.dynamics.com


Need to remove the duplicates in Customer table for Quote Detail_Quote_Number page.

Reference price for each material.
Quote table -> Reference price? (ZM09 from quotes)

Quote Detail Quote Number page -> Customer <- also needs the addition of address

Address Line 2 needs adding

Actual quantity and site quantity need to be integers.

In Materia/products gallery, del and collected need to be integers and sorted accordingly. No, the sort order of Material gallery is not clear.
when are we using "Until " & Text(DateValue(ThisItem.Column29),"dd mmm yyyy") and "From " & Text(DateValue(ThisItem.Column50),"dd mmm yyyy")?

Dataverse, can't change columns, need to introduce a new calculated column for number data type. this needs to be

Meters sq value should not be defined as default, it should be empty

Controls are not resettable within a gallery


Testing with quote: 1320460444
Test table name: ST_VBAK_VBAP_Test_News

New Table name: ST_Quotes

Performance improved a lot
DO a comparison with the old app to show the pre and post performance to Kev and explain the process

the material table is not loading very fast.
should I use a lookup joining the quotes table(ST_Quotes) with the materials table (ST_VBAPs) in dataverse for faster performance?


Get the sort order of quote materials from Kev
Filters are as follows: [cr780_column47] <> null and ([cr780_column21] = "ACTIVE") and ([cr780_column45] = "Delivery")

What will be the value of collected field? sometimes it's blank, sometimes it's the same as delivered field (was column 48 till now)
