Quote search screen -> alternate row coloring by using 

With ( {records: Filter()}, ForAll(Sequence(CountRows(records)),Patch(Last(FirstN(records,Value)), {rowNumber: Value}))

Using the ForAll sequence inside PowerApps I'm patching the rownumber inside the records.


Big time saving hack -> using dataverse direct query to import the tables inside power bi and verify the field names
Even bigger time hack -> looking at the same data inside power query by filtering a quote number
Quesiton to Kev -> ASM name has changed for quote 1320460444
Dataverse connection name: orgee143f71.crm11.dynamics.com


Need to remove the duplicates in Customer table for Quote Detail_Quote_Number page.

Reference price for each material.
Quote table -> Reference price? (ZM09 from quotes)

Quote Detail Quote Number page -> Customer <- also needs the addition of address

Address Line 2 needs adding

Actual quantity and site quantity need to be integers.

In Materia/products gallery, del and collected need to be integers and sorted accordingly. No, the sort order of Material gallery is not clear.
when are we using "Until " & Text(DateValue(ThisItem.Column29),"dd mmm yyyy") and "From " & Text(DateValue(ThisItem.Column50),"dd mmm yyyy")?

Dataverse, can't change columns, need to introduce a new calculated column for number data type. this needs to be

Meters sq value should not be defined as default, it should be empty

Controls are not resettable within a gallery -> Resetting the gallery itself on page visible does work -> This didn't work either,
to make it work, put the gallery's reset property as a variable and set that property to false and true on the OnVisible property of the
page Set(varResetEverything, true); Set(varResetEverything, false);

Gallery doesn't have the reset property, it's the individual controls inside the gallery which do, so you have to put all the controls you want to reset
as varResetEverything.


Testing with quote: 1320460444
Test table name: ST_VBAK_VBAP_Test_News

New Table name: ST_Quotes

Performance improved a lot
DO a comparison with the old app to show the pre and post performance to Kev and explain the process

the material table is not loading very fast.
should I use a lookup joining the quotes table(ST_Quotes) with the materials table (ST_VBAPs) in dataverse for faster performance?


Get the sort order of quote materials from Kev
Filters are as follows: [cr780_column47] <> null and ([cr780_column21] = "ACTIVE") and ([cr780_column45] = "Delivery")

What will be the value of collected field? sometimes it's blank, sometimes it's the same as delivered field (was column 48 till now)

Check with Kev if ANGDT and BNDDT has changed for 1320404801. 

Collect(ColMaterial3,{MatName:cmbboxitem.Selected.MAKTG, CurrDelivered:txtinputcurrentpricedel.Text, CurrCollected: txtinputcurrentpricecollect.Text,
FutureDelivered: txtinputfuturepricedel.Text, FutureCollected: txtinputfuturepricecol.Text, UoM: cmbboxitem.Selected.MEGRU}));
ForAll(qds_GalMaterial.AllItems, 
Collect(ColMaterial3,{MatName:Column42, CurrDelivered: Column47, CurrCollected: "",  FutureDelivered: "", FutureCollected: "", UoM: Column43})
);


Datatype of collection mismatching throws an error while defining the collection

ColMaterial currently only has currentdelivered as the numeric value column.

creating groups based on dates on each page

Submitted Details Screens - Add All to the dropdown of choices

Change all the global variable to local variable

Another question to Kev - how to deal with outlier cases

ST_Quote and ST_Quote_Materials are not related using a relationship because the relationship column that I created 
does not contain the values of the primary key (quotenumber) of the ST_Quote table.
So need to reload the table after truncating it using the dataflows at the end of the day so both the Quote and the Quote materials
are loaded from the same source with the Quotelookup field inside the ST_Quote_materials populated while populating the Quote Number at the same 
time.
(I'm close by)

Now the ST_Submitted_Quotes and ST_Submitted_Quotes_Material I got from Kev, I can try to load it like that.
First load the parent and the child table, then create a lookup to the child table, then truncate the child table and then reload the child table

Cool thing - you won't be able to delete a dataverse table if it's used in the canvas app (not so cool thing: you won't be able to
delete it after you remove it from the canvas app either at least until you wait a few minutes).

Loading the tables: ST_Submitted_Quotes and ST_Submitted_Quote_Materials
Creating a lookup column: Submitted_Quote_Lookup in child table related to parent table

IMP: Wasted 2 hours on this, both the parent and the child table must contain the primary key to populate the lookup field in the child table.
you can go into the table and delete multiple columns at once.

Convert date to a long date format in powerapps field form 
If outside form use the text function to wrap around it and do this: Text(ThisItem.XYZ, "dd mm YYYY")
Else just change the format to longdate inside the form (chatgpt did not know this)
Remove the inputtextplaceholder for the date controls

Formula for date time in app: 
Text(ThisItem.RequestDate, ShortDate) & " at " & Text(ThisItem.RequestDate,LongTime)

In the form fields, the default value is where it's at and you need to change the ThisItem property of the default value.
in the datafield value, the entry must be made as "cr780_requestsalesreplastname" to make it reflect inside the default field.

when introducing the app can use things like keeping the font and layout the same, 
such as using the Lato Light font for the values and the semibold for the column headers

Replaying app testing with running paralley from the existing app.
great levity to say everything
powerpoint diagram on dataverse and where the data is maintained and the logic

main thing is the functionality

a secondary presentation on features that we are allowing ASM like approval workflow.
minor details to make the two apps indistinguishable


order number: 1320420209
collected column details populating -> why, field 48 is different and field 47 is being repeated for delivery -> something that can be checked from SAP side
so Kev can quickly advise.
apart from that the sorting order of materials inside the app?
