Power BI Dax
Cool things power bi.
Measures can be used as visual slicers so a table can be filtered by a measure by adding it into the visual level filter of the table
and a manual input table's column can be used to drive it's behavior.
This is one of the coolest things in power bi.
Relationships are important.
Created calculated table from another table and could see it is not getting impacted from the date filter.
Created a relationship between this calculated table and 
the date table (relationship already existed between the date table and the old table) => 
and it is giving the correct result in terms of the calculations done with the table being filtered in the measure
(note: the table itself still holds all the date values, however the calculations done now with measures using any of the table
fields will giving the filtered result due to the relationship.
